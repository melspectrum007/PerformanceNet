PerformanceNet is a deep convolutional model that learns in an end-to-end manner the score-to-audio mapping between musical scores and the correspondant real audio performance. Our model represents an early yet valuable attemp to achieve the dream of **The AI performer**.

## Prerequisites

> __Below we assume the working directory is the repository root.__

### Install dependencies

  ```sh
  # Install the dependencies
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Prepare training data

> PerformanceNet utilizes the [MusicNet](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~thickstn/start.html) dataset
, which provides musical scores and the correspondant performance audio data.

```sh
# Download the training data
./scripts/download_data.sh
```
You can also download the training data manually
([musicnet.npz](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~thickstn/media/musicnet.npz)).

> Pre-process the dataset into pianorolls and spectrogram used for training PerformanceNet.

```sh
# Pre-process the dataset
./scripts/process_data.sh
```
